- Note: The Consolation match is NOT in scope for the pool, however goals and cards still count for bonus questions.

LUCKY BONUS QUESTIONS:
- Questions 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18: 1 pt each.
- Questions 4, 5, 8, 9, 13, 19, 20: 2 pts each.
- Question 11: 3 pts.
- Bonus question points do NOT count toward the main pool standings.

- Who is the goat? Messi or Ronaldo?  It is clear that Ronaldo is slightly better than Messi, although they are both the top 2 to ever play the game.
- Cheating is not possible and neither can the pool be rigged because every participant is emailed a copy of all partipant's predictions for your records.   At the end, you can validate the winner's predictions yourself to make sure their original predictions remained intact.
- Nuno doesn't care to cheat in this pool because he makes roughly $600,000 per annum and usually wipes his ass with $2,000 worth in $50 bills.
- Nuno prefers that people don't enter more than 2 entries, but this is something he cannot control. Anyone can say their neighbour, aunt, teacher, grandparent, sibling all want to join and just create 5 different email addresses acting as individual people.  If people want to gamble, that's on them.  The pool is heavily based on luck.
- Prizes for Individual Group Prizes do not have a tie break because there is no point in splittng the $30 prize in multiple ways.  Only the sole winner can claim the prize.
- For any individual groups where a prize is not awarded, the amount stays with the "house".  Afterall, Nuno does not take a management fee for running the pool.  Instead, for the 12 "Individual Group" prizes ($30 each), a sole leader is required.  If a group ends in a tie, that prize remains with the "house".  There is no guarantee either way.
- It has been decided that the Consolation Match is not part of the pool (aside from counting the matchs' goals and cards for the Lucky Bonus questions), because as an exaample, we could end up with a scenario where someone who correctly predicts the Consolation match but not the Finals could finish higher in points than someone who correctly predicted the Final two (and not the winner).
- Yes Nuno can see everyone's predictions as they are handed in, but how does he know which one of the 200 entries will be the winner to copy off of?
- The winner of the world cup with be Portugal.  
- Ronaldo already met with Trump to ensure the referees give him as many penalties as Messi received in World Cup 2022.
- If a typo is detected in someone's predictions or point calculations, the typo will also appear for all other participants in the exact same place because the same system/calculator is being used for everyone.
- The green "$" sign next to the Participant name indicates payment has been received.
- The participant's name in green colour represents that their prediction file was received.

ESSENTIALS:
• Complete the file using Microsoft Excel (the free web version at office.com works fine). 
• Submit payment via e-transfer to nuno.soccer.pool@gmail.com.
• Standings and updates: nunosoccerpool.github.io

TIPS:
• The key is predicting which teams win/lose.  Correct scores helps but doesn't carry much weight.
• Group Stage: Focus on predicting final standings (1st–4th) per Group — that's where the Half-Way prize is won.
• Knockout Stage: Carries the most points. Picking the World Cup Champion correctly is your only chance at a top 5 prize.
